Events & Choices Players will interact with NPCs, choose responses, and participate in the following events:

Dance-off: Player must win a dance-off by rolling higher than the NPC's challenge dice roll. Read-off: Player must win a verbal sparring match.

Combat System The game uses dice rolls to resolve conflicts and challenges:

For a dance-off, the player rolls a dice against the NPC. A higher number wins. For a read-off, uniqueness is the key stat, and the player must roll higher to win. NPC Interactions NPCs give hints about RuPaul's location, offer challenges, or join the player's team. Dialogue is influenced by dice rolls, and LLM-generated content is used to create dynamic conversations.
